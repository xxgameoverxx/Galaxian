		<Description tag="wave">Welcome aboard captain! Since this is your first mission let me explain how this ship works...
		Move your ship with WASD buttons on your console and shoot with SPACE. Yep, it's that simple to control a space ship
		since we made signed contract with Apple. The word is next gen iShips will have only one button! How awesome is this?
		
		Anyway, back to the mission... As you know we are in war with those evil alien bastards and you have been chosen among
		the best pilots of Planet Earth in order to bring some democracy to their planet.
		
		Oh! Look! There is a small squad of alien fighters! Quick, get them!

		<Description tag="wave">Well, this was relatively easy. I wonder what they were doing so close to the Earth... Well, I guess we'll never learn.
		Your first mission, captain is to deliver this ship to a super secret military outpost not too far from Mars. Be careful
		thou, there may be more of them on the way and usually they are not this easy to defeat.</Description>
